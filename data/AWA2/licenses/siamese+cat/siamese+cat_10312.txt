Hawkeye_1204


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
Hawkeye is a big, handsome male Siamese.
Like many Siamese cats, Hawkeye can be a bit feisty, but is still a very loving cat. Sometimes he likes to sit in peoples laps, and he always loves human attention.
Hawkeye knows his name, and when he is in the mood he'll come when he is called. If the caller has treats, so much the better!
On most days, you can find Hawkeye sunning himself in the outdoor yard with his feline buddies.
He gets along well with people of all ages and other cats but may not do so well around dogs. Hawkeye would love a home of his own and with the baby blue eyes, how could you resist him? Come on down to RMFR and adopt Hawkeye today!
Hawkeye is FeLV+, but very healthy at this time. We think he was born in 2007.
