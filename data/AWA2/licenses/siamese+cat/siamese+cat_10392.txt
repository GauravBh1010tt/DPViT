Quincy Comes Calling


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
For a while, Quincy the Siamese cat was a regular visitor at our back door.  

I suspect it was the feline busybody in Quincy that drew him to our back door initially. 

Once Quincy discovered that two cats could be found lounging in the sun that came through the window, though, he kept coming back to socialize with them.

Cats being cats, they could stand only so much direct eye contact.  Then would follow a period when both sides would studiously look away from one another until some internal timer told them they could resume the visit.
