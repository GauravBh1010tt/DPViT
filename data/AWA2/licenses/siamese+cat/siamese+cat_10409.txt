SAVED! (Scared Siamese)


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
&quot;Kerry Hilliard - poor baby, nice meaning older couple took her from a not so great situation, she's terrified, love cats but not much experience, she bit, lady to hospital, she hisses every time they try to crawl under bed and pull her out, hisses and claws. Was working with them via email on how to let her calm down and learn to love them. They really did want to help, just so flustered, never been around a terrified kitty. Then she got thru an access port in the closet out into the rafter area over the overhang of the house. I went to their house yesterday to try and help get her out. It was an itty bitty space that I could not get in any further than about 24&quot; ... it went way back, maybe 18&quot; at the highest with a criss cross of rafters ... I couldn't even see her or catch any eye shine. I set a trap and taught them how to use it and explained about it and never never open it once we get her. Call me. So I went back over this morning after she'd gone in the trap. If you approach rapidly and try ti stick fingers in to pat she hisses. She is terrified. If you go slow, throw kitty kisses, merow and talk, she talks back, she batts eyes back. Obviously not a feral kitty. Their vet had said feral and to call me. But she's not, she's not even a mean biting friendly. She's just a terrified gal. I was able to pat her thru the trap after laying down next to her and talking. The people felt way to overwhelmed to try and work with her. That had been the goal, to help them help her so she had a nice home. Anyway I brought her home with me. She's so scared. We had a little bit of snuggly time before she bolted to a hidely hole. I'll sleep with her for the next couple days and I think she'll come round pretty easy. Hoping she ends up friendly enough to be at the education center with the others for adoption.&quot;
