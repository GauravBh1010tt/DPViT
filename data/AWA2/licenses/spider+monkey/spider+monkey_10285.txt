Why hello, baby spider monkey

|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
The best thing about the Jungle Lodge in Tikal is that there are spider monkeys and howler monkeys all over the place. This was literally ten feet from our cabana. Seeing a monkey in the wild for the first time is...breathtaking. His mom was a little way off, but he seemed to enjoy looking at me.
