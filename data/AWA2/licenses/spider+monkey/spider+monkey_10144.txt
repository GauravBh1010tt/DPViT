|  TITLE  |
+---------+
Spider Monkey (Ateles geoffroyi)


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
Spider monkeys live in medium-sized, loosely associated groups of about 30 individuals, which fragment into subgroups of varying smaller sizes and composition. Unless there is an abundance of preferred food available, the subgroup size will consist of fewer than 4 animals. These groups will roam independently in the same general area; the only persistent association is that of a female with her offspring. Spider monkeys are diurnal and at night use sleeping trees which are usually tall enough so that the crown is free from the canopy beneath it having a broad open crown that has horizontally forked branches for prolonged resting postures.
