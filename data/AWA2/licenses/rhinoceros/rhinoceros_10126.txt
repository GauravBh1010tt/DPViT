Bhopu the Greater one-horned male Rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis) taking a drink


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
The Indian rhinoceros or the greater one-horned rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis) is now found almost exclusively in Nepal and North-Eastern India. The Indian rhinoceros has thick, silver-brown skin which creates huge folds all over its body. Its upper legs and shoulders are covered in wart-like bumps, and it has very little body hair. 

Bhopu is at the San Diego Safari Park in Escondido, CA. The rhino's single horn is present in both males and females, but not on newborn young. The black horn, like human fingernails, is pure keratin and starts to show after about 6 years. Bhopu's has been worn down naturally by rubbing on trees and rocks.
