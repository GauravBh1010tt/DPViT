A Speke's Gazelle faces a White Rhino at the Phoenix Zoo

The Southern White Rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum simum) is one of the two subspecies of the White Rhinoceros or Square-lipped rhinoceros (the other being the much rarer Northern White Rhino). The White Rhino is one of the five species of rhinoceros that still exist and is one of the few megafaunal species left. It has a wide mouth used for grazing and is the most social of all rhino species. This photo was taken at the Phoenix Zoo on March 12, 2011.
