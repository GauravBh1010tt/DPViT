Black Rhino


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
This Rhino is also known as the Hook-Lipped Rhino, which is a far more descriptive name, as they certainly aren't black. Both Black and White Rhinos both graze and browse, however the White Rhino is much larger, and the Black Rhino tends to hold it's head up, while the White Rhino keeps it's head lower. Also the concave back of the Black Rhino is very noticable in this picture.

Rhino have very poor eyesight - they can only really see clearly up to about 15 meters. If you approach from downwind quietly and slowly, you can get very close without them knowing.
Sometimes a fleeing Rhino is mistaken for a charge as the Rhino panics and runs away in any direction, but because their eyesight is so bad they may accidentally run towards the threat.
