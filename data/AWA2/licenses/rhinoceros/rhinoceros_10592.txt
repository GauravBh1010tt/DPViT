+---------+
The rhino continues to graze


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
The rhino continued grazing, his muzzle to the ground all the time. Rhinos have poor eyesight, and generally do not react even when you approach fairly close. They however are known to suddenly charge without provocation, which makes them very dangerous animals, especially with their weight. And when they do charge, it's the real thing, not a false charge like an elephant does. (Oct/ Nov 2010)
