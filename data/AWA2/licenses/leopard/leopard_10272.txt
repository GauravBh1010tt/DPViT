Leopard in Heat

|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
When we came back a couple days later, she was up in the tree, and he approached on the ground.  She made an even louder racket and let out a loud bark at him.

Click photo to see larger; there is a lot of detail.

He turns away and saunters offâ€¦.   (jump shot below, and then <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jurvetson/5913330010">next</a>)
