+---------------+
Direct eye contact is awesome but sometimes feels pretty intimidating too. This was shot during one of our training tours. It was after hours, a time when the animals are not accustomed to having any people around; maybe that's why we got the warning growl you see here. I was lucky enough to catch my shot and make eye/camera contact as the cat scanned along the line of people in our class. This look wasn't directed just at me only, and after the growl, we were promptly ignored.
