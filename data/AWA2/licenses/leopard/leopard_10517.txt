Persian Leopard

|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
A day trip to Chessington with the children proved an excellent excuse to take the camera with me, mostly on the pretence of shooting pictures of them, but secretly of course, just like any other photography fanatic, I hoped for the chance of some shots of the big cats, the sealions and the gorilla's.

I had always previously found it tough to shoot behind glass, but having read up on it, changed some of my camera settings to suit and applied some of the rules of shooting behind glass I had learnt, came up with a couple of decent pictures. This was one of my favourites.
