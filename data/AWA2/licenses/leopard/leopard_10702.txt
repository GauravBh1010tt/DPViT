Why Kiara?


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
Meet Kiara, a persian leopard at Dierenpark Amersfoort, the Netherlands. On Octobre 15th 2010 she gave birth to a son, Cyrus. Everything seemed fine ... untill sunday January 30th 2011. That morning mom suddenly killed her own son. Why is still a mystery. Was it an accident? Did something startle her? Was it an intentional kill? Or did Kiara notice something was wrong with the baby, and did she end the baby's suffering? Hopefully the autopsy of the baby will clear it up. In the meantime it's a sad sight, seeing mom all alone.
