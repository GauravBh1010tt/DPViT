Arabian Leopard or 'Nimr'


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
A final look at the Arabian Leopard before we move on. These are not repetitive shots fired in 'muti shot' mode. Rather the animal kept going back and forth all the time, so although the pictures appear to be identical, they are shot during several of the animal's back and forth pacings. For more notes on the Arabian Leopard, please see my 'Fauna- Al Ain Zoo' album. (Emirates Park Zoo, Samha, Abu Dhabi, Jan. 2015)
