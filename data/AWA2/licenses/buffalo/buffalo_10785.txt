Second attempt to take photo of a bison - he also proceeded to poop upon seeing us


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
Ate lunch at a cheese/bison bistro in Minnesota on Saturday. After we ate (I had a bison burger, hubby had bison chili and half a sandwich), we went behind the restaurant to see the live bison. Every single time I tried to take a picture of one, a tail would go up, and plop...they would take a dump. No kidding. See pictures labeled Bison 1, Bison 2, Bison 3 for the true order of stinkiness.
