Bison


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
Bison are to me a symbol of America, but also are a story with a moral.  This symbol of America was nearly driven to extinction by the excesses of Americans who so impressed by their vast numbers felt they were a resource that could be frivolously wasted.  Americans who ever live for today and as if there is no tomorrow, hate to be wakened from their selfish dream.
