43 Bison in the road


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
We sat about 25 minutes waiting for the bison to cross the road. I don't know why they would want to just stand on the hot blacktop, but they must have liked it! We saw bison in three other locations along the 14-mile North Unit Scenic Byway, but this was the largest group.
