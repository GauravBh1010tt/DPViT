Feeding Buffalo on the Hells Canyon Scenic Byway in Baker County Oregon. 

Got to spend Sunday morning with the folks at Oregon Trail Bison Ranch near the town of Halfway, feeding buffalo. What a fun way to start a Sunday along the Hells Canyon Scenic Byway 

Hells Canyon Scenic Byway is a loop that encircles the Wallowa Mountains, intersecting with Interstate 84 at Baker City and La Grande.   They byway runs through some of North Oregon’s most rugged and majestic landscapes including a few surprises like this Buffalo Ranch near the small town of Halfway  in Baker County. 

 The entire route is on a paved highway. Plan ahead - you'll find stretches of more than eighty miles without gas and with few services. A segment of the Byway between Joseph and Halfway closes with snow in winter, but allows access to winter recreation areas, offering a whole other kind of Northeast Oregon Adventure.

Hwy 86 between Baker City and the Hells Canyon Dam at the bottom of the canyon is open year round providing visitors access to the deepest river gorge in North America. 
 
Spring and early summer is one of our favorite times to visit the byway and enjoy the abundant wildlife wild flowers, and ever changing scenery
