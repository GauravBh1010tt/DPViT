Wildlife!

|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
After we finished driving through The Needles, we were on the first half of the wildlife loop, on our way to Wind Cave.

Further down the road, we had to drive through the herd. I believe we were still in Custer Park at this time, and this is their herd, but it might have been Wind Cave's herd, I'm not sure.
