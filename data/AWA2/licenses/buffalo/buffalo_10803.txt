The Bison


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
Once hunted nearly to extinction, the Bison has returned.

Yesterday at the Wichita Wild Life Refuge

ed ed started me thinking about it again.


This one turned and observed us for several minutes.  

They make a growling sound so low and gentle it is almost like a purr. But donâ€™t be mistaken, he was warning us to stay away. 

He finally decided we were not going to approach any further and returned to foraging in the tall grass prairie.
