Memorial Day Weekend Along the Hells Canyon Scenic Byway 

Spent a beautiful Memorial Day Weekend exploring the Hells Canyon Scenic Byway along the Snake River in Baker County Oregon .  Spring is a beautiful time to visit the byway.  The wildflowers are blooming and the snowcapped Wallowa and Elkhorn mountains are picture perfect as you head into the arid canyon and down the banks of the Snake River.  For more information about the Hells Canyon Scenic Byway including sites and attractions to visit along the way visit the Baker County Tourism website at <a href="http://www.basecampbaker.com" rel="nofollow">www.basecampbaker.com</a>
