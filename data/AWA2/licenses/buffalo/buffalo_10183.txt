+---------+
Bison Disregarding Irrelevancies


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
This bison was right at the edge of the road; I took the photo without telephoto through the open car window.   He was paying no more attention to traffic passing by than to that &quot;controlled burn&quot; in the background.   He had a lot of grass to eat.
