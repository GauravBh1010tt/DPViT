Wiley doesn't always come in the light, so I don't always get to photograph him,  yesterday I whistled for him as he come to the whistle,  for every pose he had a piece of chicken, and when I think he has done enough he has a bowl of it, so gets paid in Kind, thank you for your lovely comments, as soon as I can get his heavily pregnant Vixen in the daylight I will show you her.
Graham Wiley is very much wild, he is tame to a point, i.e will take food, but I cannot touch him even if he sits next to me, and last night he wondered through my gate ( I have 2) and you could see the I feel cornered look, so I moved out the way so he could go out, i would not like a too tame fox, because some not nice people out there, and he needs to keep his wits about him )))
