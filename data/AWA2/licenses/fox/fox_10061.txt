|  TITLE  |
+---------+
A vixen is a female fox.


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
I don't actually know if this is a female, but I will assume she is, because that is more fun.  

<i>O, when she is angry she is keen and shrewd;
She was a vixen when she went to school,
And though she be but little, she is fierce.</i>
-- Shakespeare, Midsummer Night's Dream
