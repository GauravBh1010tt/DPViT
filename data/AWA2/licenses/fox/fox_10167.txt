Fox ?

|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
This animal was foraging for food and wasn't all that shy of a few people mulling around. (always inclusive of idiots with the P&amp;S cameras who want to go as close as possible. Oh also kids and adults who act like kids who *have* to SHOUT out to their entire family to come and see the animal)
