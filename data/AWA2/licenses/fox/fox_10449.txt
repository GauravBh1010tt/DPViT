Oops, I woke up the Fox asleep by my backdoor


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
This fox found a spot in the sun next to my back door.  He was there for a good hour.  Every now and then he would sit up and look at me a few metres away, and then promptly go straight back to sleep without a care in the world.
