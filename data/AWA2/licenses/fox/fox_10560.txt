Redhill Garden Dusk - June 2015 - Our New Fox Spots Me at the Window


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
So surprised was he that his jaw dropped. Since our neighbour returned from Spain with a young cat our garden has lost its pigeon colony so now the fat ball droppings are not cleaned up by them but by our young fox who arrives just before dusk to enjoy a rather meagre feast though he does usually find some of our dogs food to supplement it somewhat. He is a real beauty.
