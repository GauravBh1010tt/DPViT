Redhill Wildlife Centre - Feb 2012 - Mr. Fox Shows His Profile

|  DESCRIPTION  |

Picture 2 of 3
Our dog, Button, has been off his food recently since catching 'Kennel Cough' so his food had been hanging around in his bowl for a couple of days. As I hate waste of any kind I thought I would let this beautiful dog fox decide if he could use it. He didn't think twice and made very short shrift of it.
This is his second visit of the day as I saw him eating the peanuts and suet I put out for the birds so as he was looking both cold and hungry I took pity on him and put out the scraps. As you can see he can see me through the kitchen window but since he was pretty desperate at this time he ate the food while keeping a close eye on me. (Not this picture)
As you know I am very fond of foxes so this was a magic moment for me and my camera. This is the first time I have got pictures of one in the garden in daylight, I normally have to get up at dawn on a Summer's morning to get any pictures. It was well worth the wait and I hope you agree. I put this one up as it highlights the rather distinctive markings on this side of his face. I do not believe that that is dirt so he must have inherited to some impressive moles from his parents.
