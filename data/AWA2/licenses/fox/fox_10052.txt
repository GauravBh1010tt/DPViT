2012s First Cub Over the Fence


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
Titled as such because we have seen 4 cubs playing in next door's garden! This must be the eldest and bravest as he will quite happily have a go at the adults. However, wisdom doesn't come with gusto, as here he is pictured half soaked after falling in to the pond for the second time!
