+---------+
Living in a Prairie Dog Town


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
This Swift fox (Vulpes velox) doesn't mind living in town (a black-tailed prairie dog town), where the grocery store is never far.  He prefers to do his shopping at night and just might bump into his neighbor, the black-footed ferret on this private land in western Kansas.
