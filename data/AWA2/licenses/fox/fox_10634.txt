Vulpes vulpes fulva - Red Fox, hit by a car.

|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
Somewhere out there in my neighborhood tonight, a bunch of baby foxes are waiting for their Momma, but she's not coming home... (I base this assumption on the fact that this fox was obviously breastfeeding)

There are plenty of Red Foxes in this area, and there might be more than this badly fragmented habitat could support, if it weren't for the &quot;apex predator&quot; of our time, the automobile.

This fox was on a narrow/nonexistent shoulder beneath a steep drop off from a thin wooded margin along a very busy road. I dragged it back about 10 feet before photographing it, because otherwise I would have been in the path of oncoming traffic myself.

This might be my favorite local mammal. Such a beautiful intelligent creature. I have watched a few generations of foxes grow up in Columbia Gardens Cemetery. This was only a few blocks from there, so I am guessing she was somehow related to that family, but I'm not sure how.

What looks like wear to the tip of the tooth is actually fresh damage from the auto impact. This appears to be a fairly young fox, perhaps she was born in the cemetery maybe two years ago and dispersed in an attempt to find her own territory. This might have been her first litter. I can't imagine it is the old cemetery matriarch, unless this was a new old cemetery matriarch (foxes don't live forever, even if they manage to avoid being struck by cars) Now I have to resist the urge to try and find the starving kits, who are clearly better off not being bottle-fed by sentimental humans.
