Poor old Chap (1)

|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
Seen at the end of my garden. This 'poor old' fox is probably not as old as he looks. Suffering from the mange, he had scratched so much that he was bleeding under the jaw. We sat, and watched each other, for a few minutes; he then walked off to hide nearby.
