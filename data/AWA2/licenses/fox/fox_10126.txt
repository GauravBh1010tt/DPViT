Curious eyes

|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
I had the most fantastic experience yesterday evening. I ran into a wild red fox (they're not at all uncommon to see around here), &amp; he was about to bolt, but then stopped &amp; looked back at me. I've been around animals all my life, &amp; I love em, so I tried to make myself non-threatening while talking to him in a low, soft voice.

It worked!

Over the course of around 15 minutes, he kept trying to get closer, before darting away again, until at last he came within about 6 feet (2 yards) of me. This is what I snapped right as he was making that final walk towards me.

In completely unrelated news, does anybody have any good home remedies for rabies?

Only joking :) I know I know, wild foxes often = rabies, &amp; I did consider that while watching him walk wide circles around me - clearly wanting to come closer out of curiosity - but I just couldn't pull myself away. Besides just loving animals, I adored the fox all while growing up; it easily was my favorite animal, for many reasons. After last night, I think that love affair might be coming back...

I almost cried. Srsly.
