<b>Tales of Old Kingswood Forest</b>

21st December 1776

On Wednesday last, Mr Hathway of Pucklechurch was going out with his hunting harriers when they accidentally took the scent of a fox; After leading his pursuers two rings the fox took to the hills and ran first to Sir William Codrington's woods at Doddington, then to the Duke of Beaufort's woods at Didmarton, thence to Upton Kilcott and was at last killed between Kilcott and Procester. 

&quot;Out of seventeen harrier dogs, only six were in at the death. They ran near 50 miles and the fox was the largest ever seen in these parts.&quot;

(This must be the origin of the expression &quot;To run rings-around&quot;, though the quick brown fox was unsuccessful on this occasion.)

(Sir Christopher William Codrington (12 March 1805 â€“ 24 June 1864), of Dodington, Gloucestershire, was a British MP for East Gloucestershire between 7 August 1834 and 24 June 1864 and a landowner in Gloucestershire.)

'Running rings around' originated as an English hunting term. It was used by fox-hunters but more often by those indulging in hare-coursing, which is now banned in the UK. The circling runs made by the hare in its attempts to outrun the chasing greyhounds were called rings.

&quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog&quot; is an English-language pangram-a phrase that contains all of the letters of the English alphabet. It has been used to test typewriters and computer keyboards, and in other applications involving all of the letters in the English alphabet. Owing to its brevity and coherence, it has become widely known.
