Bread for the Birds


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
Well it was for the birds. I know foxes divide opinion but I am happy to have them as visitors to my garden. This one looks in great condition in preparation for the winter. As usual, this is taken from my upstairs spare bedroom hide through the double glazing.....In case you think it looks wary you're right. If my female cat Maisie was around she'd chase it out of the garden, but she was asleep on the sofa at the time.

PS I have been asked to point out that a diet of bread alone for wild birds is not good for them. In practice they don't ever get it before the foxes. My normal feed for the bird is sunflower seed, nyger seed, peanuts, fruit and suet slabs, fat balls and meal worms in the winter. Thanks to Lili from France for asking me to make this clear.
