European Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes)


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
European Red Fox ( Vulpes vulpes ), seen at the sewage treatment works, Lake Cargelligo, NSW, Australia, during my visit in January 2012.

Introduced in the 1800s for recreational hunting, the European Red Fox is now found over much of the country. What those short-sighted hunters didn't know is that this act caused much grief to both domestic livestock and native wildlife (as well as another big pest, the rabbit). In fact the fox can be partly attributed to the declines of many native mammals, birds and reptiles.

You may copy or link this image for use under Creative Commons licence. I would especially be happy to to see it being used for invasive species awareness campaigns. If a larger sized image is required, please contact me via Flickr mail.

This image was used in a fox trapping brochure in Western Australia in 2012.

This image was used a 2013 article on <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/natural-sciences/sheepdog-bodyguard-protect-endangered-penguins-foxes-autralia.html" rel="nofollow">Treehugger</a> on protecting Little Penguins from foxes in Australia.

This image was used in the 2014 site, <a href="http://www.yourgenome.org/interactives/saving-the-devil/" rel="nofollow">Saving the Devil</a>, making awareness of the plight of the Tasmanian Devil.
