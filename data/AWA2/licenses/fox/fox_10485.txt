Red Fox #1


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
Aneroid, Saskatchewan, Canada
June 27th, 2006

Returning to Saskatchewan a year after making my “Three Red Foxes” image, I wasted no time in locating the den and setting up a folding chair and tripod nearby.

These foxes are well liked by the local farmers, since they prey on animals such as gophers which damage crops.
