Red and Grey Foxes establishing territory on San Joaquin NWR

|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
One of our frequent visitors to San Joaquin National Wildlife Refuge caught an awesome interaction between red and grey foxes this week.  Rick Kimble, an avid photographer who lives near the refuge saw these two foxes vying for dominance Monday evening, March 25, along the refuge's walking trail.  In that moment when the red fox bared its teeth and the grey crouched in submission, Rick took this photograph.   Rick explains: &quot;I stopped by the refuge last night on my way home and walked down the public trail. I heard these two before I saw them. They were so distracted I got right up on them. When they heard the shutter they were off in a flash... I doubt I will ever get another chance like that.&quot;  (USFWS Photo courtesy of Rick Kimble)
