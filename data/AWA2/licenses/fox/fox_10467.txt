Peter

|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
This is Peter, the red fox who passes by my house daily - typically between 6 &amp; 6:30. We've interacted twice now, &amp; while he certainly is accustomed to humans, he'll retreat from any perceived advance.

What I love about him is his remarkable curiousity. He wants to know what I'm all about. Earlier this week while working outside on my computer he appeared as usual, but instead of seeing me &amp; turning tail (so to speak) for better hunting grounds, he sat for awhile to watch me, then actually curled up &amp; laid down, not once letting me out of his sight. I made a wide berth with my camera, &amp; while he was wary, he never left. In fact, later on he laid down again for about ten minutes, then got up, stretched like a sleepy cat, &amp; spent about five minutes playfully rolling around in the middle of my lawn, all the while knowing I was there, watching.

I'm growing quite fond of him. I look forward to seeing him again tomorrow.
