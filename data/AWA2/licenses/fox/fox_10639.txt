Walking maned wolf


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
This is a mane wolf, which has not to be confused with a fox, even if they have the same coloring but the maned wolf has much longer legs. Finally the maned wolf is still genetically closer to a fox than a wolf...
Taken at the Mulhouse zoo.
