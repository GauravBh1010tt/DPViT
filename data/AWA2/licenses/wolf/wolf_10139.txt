Female Gray Wolf


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
The scientific name for a gray wolf is Canis lupus. Scientific names are always in latin, no matter what language you speak. The first name, or genus name, should be capitilized, and the second name, or species name, is lowercase. Also - imagine that it is in italics or underlined. ~ Intern Karen
