Grey wolves


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
These photos were taken one week before five of the six wolves escaped. One returned to the enclosure, one was shot with a tranquiliser dart but three had to be shot by marksmen. Unfortunately, an anaesthetic dart takes 15 minutes to take effect and may not work at all in a stressed animal so the wolves that were a danger to the public had to be shot. Very sad, beautiful animals, just doing what wolves do.
