Gray Wolf


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
Denali is one of the best places in the world to see wolves in the wild. Wolves live in packs, usually containing a dominant pair, their offspring, and other non-breeding adults. Wolf packs usually live within a specific territory. These territories range in size depending on how much prey is available, but typically measure 200 to 1,000 square miles. Wolves may travel as far as 30 miles in a day moving along at 5 miles per hour, but can reach speeds of 45 miles per hour for short distances.
