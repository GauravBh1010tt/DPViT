What's up, coyote?

|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
The coyote is looking at my camera lens.

Wawona Road @ Yosemite Nat'l Park, California


David's thoughts about his picture selected in top 25 of 2011:

Everyone thinks this animal is no other than coyote:  dog, wolf, or fox.  The wild coyote is roaming on the Yosemite wildness, as coyote is walking near the paved road of Wawona Road.  My friend and driver saw the coyote and decide to slow down their car on the road and I took my camera out from the bag quickly, capture several two dozen shots to get good picture in less than a minute.

This coyote is approximately 15-20 feet away from the car as I was in front passenger seat.
