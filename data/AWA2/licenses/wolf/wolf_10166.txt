Gray Wolf


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
Since 1939, when noted biologist Adolph Murie first began studying Denali wolf packs, the park has been treasured as one of the few spots on Earth where wolves range free in their natural setting relatively undisturbed by development. Biologists continue to study Denali’s wolves today, relying on molecular genetics and radio telemetry instead of dog teams and long hours hiking, as in Murie’s day.
