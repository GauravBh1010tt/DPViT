Golden Jackal


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
Golden Jackal ( Canis aureus) or the Common or Asiatic Jackal is one of the most widely distributed animals in Africa, Europe and Asia. Recent development in cellular studies suggest that the Golden Jackal is more closely affiliated to the Wolf and Coyote family than with the other Jackals. Though Jackals are very social, this specimen was seen foraging alone in Corbett National Park, Uttarakhand, India. March 2013
