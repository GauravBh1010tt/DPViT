Polar Bear at Singapore zoo


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
One of the star attractions in the Polar Bear enclosure at the Singapore zoo is the prospect of seeing the beast swimming underwater. A large glass portion has been provided for the purpose. Both the polar bears were basking on the shore when we visited unfortunately. One of them eventually did enter the water, but only rear end first, and upto the hip. Now we couldn't possible take an underwater shot of the Polar bear's butt, so we took this picture instead. The green colour on the otherwise white fur of the polar bear is due to the presence of algae in the water. A couple of years later, the BBC ran a story of this fellow turning purple. Same reason: algae. A different form of algae perhaps.  (Aug. 2002)(Loss of colour and quality due to scan from print: photo was taken on 35mm film). UPDATE: This polar bear, named 'Sheba' by the Singapore zoo, died in November 2012 at the age of 35.
