Female Lion


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
A small child who had been running around and hitting things with some inflatable shoved his fingers through the grate at the lion cage.  He asked &quot;Can they get out&quot;.  Before his parents could allay his fears I said &quot;Of course&quot;.  I didn't hear if his parents corrected me.
