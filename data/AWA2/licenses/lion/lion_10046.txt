African Lion Spotted in Colorado! From <a href="http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/16877102/detail.html" rel="nofollow">ABC 7 News Denver</a>:



COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. -- El Paso County deputies are looking for an African lion on the loose in the eastern part of the county.

Sheriff's Lt. Lari Sevene said the first call came in of large cat chasing several dogs through a field off of Log Road. That call came in at 7:35 a.m. The resident told deputies the cat had a red mane and a big tail. Officers obtained a photo of the big cat.

A second sighting was reported after the first and a second resident also took a picture of the lion.

A reverse-911 alert went out to residents in the Falcon Highway and Log Road area to let them know about the animal. A second call will go out when the coast is clear.

State wildlife officers found tracks of the lion, according to the Colorado Springs Gazette.

Michael Seraphin, of the Colorado Division of Wildlife, told the Gazette that the two photos taken by residents and tracks found by DOW officers confirm the animal is an African lion and not a mountain lion.
