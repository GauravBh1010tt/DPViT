|  TITLE  |
+---------+
Lion King, Taronga Zoo, Sydney


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
The lion enclosure is separated by a glass wall, which allows people to come within a few centimerters of the animals. Not sure if the lion sees anything, but the child reflected in the glass was certainly excited.
