Lion


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
A male lion, catching the last rays of sun in the chilly afternoon. The temperature is about -3 Celsius, but this big sack of meat doesn't seem to care. They probably don't have snow in Africa, but hey - this is the king of the jungle, he won't be bothered by such nonsense.
