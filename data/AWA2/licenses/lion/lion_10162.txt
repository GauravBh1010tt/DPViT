|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
PLEASE, no multi invitations, glitters or self promotion in your comments, THEY WILL BE DELETED.  My photos are FREE for anyone to use, just give me credit and it would be nice if you let me know, thanks - NONE OF MY PICTURES ARE HDR.

Unique to the Timbavati region of South Africa, these rare and beautiful cats have not been seen in the wild in over 15 years. They carry the recessive gene known as a colour inhibitor of the Kruger subspecies of lion. With lion populations dwindling, they are now classified as a vulnerable species
