|  TITLE  |
+---------+
The Lion 'King'


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
I've seen this lion several times over the past four or five years. Each time he looks so sweet &amp; helpless. As if he has some kind of identity crisis: &quot;Me? A King? Oh no, I'm just a sweet kitty!&quot;

Please give credit &amp; link back to this page. 
And please don't claim this to be your own, nor sell it 'as is' (or just slightly changed). 

Thanks for every view, comment, fave or invite. I really keep on appreciating every single one :)) !!

Update 2016: apparently this lion was called Chandra and he has passed away some time ago ...
