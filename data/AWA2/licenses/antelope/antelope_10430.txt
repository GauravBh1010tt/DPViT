Grant's Gazelle babies (Nanger granti)


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
The Grant's gazelle (Nanger granti) is a species of gazelle. Its populations are distributed from northern Tanzania to southern Sudan and Ethiopia. The most distinguishing feature of this pale fawn gazelle is the distinct vertical black stripe that runs down either side of the white buttocks. The underparts and inner legs are also white, and the tail is white at the base but has longer black hair towards the tip. The eyes are set in leaf-shaped, jet-black patches of skin.

Photographed at San Diego Zoo Safari Park in Escondido, CA
