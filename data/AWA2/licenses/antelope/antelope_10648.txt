Longleat Safari & Adventure Park 24-09-2013

|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
Longleat Safari &amp; Adventure Park has been one of the UK’s best-loved attractions for over 60 years. It features an extensive Safari Park, is home to BBC Animal Park and CBBC Roar and also has over 20 fabulous attractions, including Penguin Island, The Jungle Cruise, Monkey Temple and Longleat House, one of the most stunning stately homes in Britain.

Longleat Safari Park
The UK’s no. 1 Safari Park first opened its gates to the public in April 1966; the first of its kind outside Africa. It was the beginning of a revolution in zoological collections that has spread all over the globe.
For the very first time, animals were able to move freely across hundreds of acres of land and interact naturally with each other.
Today it is difficult to imagine the furore aroused when Longleat’s plans for an initial 100-acre lion reserve were made public. There were dire warnings of big cats running amok in the Wiltshire countryside, local clergymen were up in arms, and there were even questions asked in the Houses of Parliament.
In spite of these fears, the ground-breaking concept of the drive through safari park proved a hugely popular draw for visitors. Over forty years on, Longleat Safari Park remains one of the country’s leading wildlife attractions.

Longleat Adventure Park
Over the years Longleat has grown to incorporate a whole range of fun-packed family attractions, including Jungle Kingdom, where visitors can get right up close to animals such as meerkats, anteaters, porcupine. Other highlights include the Adventure Castle - an amazing kid’s adventure playground and castle, the Longleat Hedge Maze - one of the world’s longest labyrinths, and new attractions including the Rockin Rhino ride, Penguin Island and Stingray Bay.

Longleat House
Set within 900 acres of Capability Brown landscaped grounds, Longleat House is widely regarded as one of the best examples of high Elizabethan architecture in Britain and one of the most beautiful stately homes open to the public.
Built by Sir John Thynne from 1568 and visited by Elizabeth I in 1574, Longleat House is the home of the 7th Marquess of Bath, Alexander Thynn. It was the first stately home to open to the public on a fully commercial basis back on 1st April 1949.
