\And <a href="http://www.holyspiritspeaks.org/god-himself-the-unique-i/" rel="nofollow">God</a> said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so. And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creeps on the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
