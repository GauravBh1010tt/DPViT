Grant's Gazelle


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
Tsavo East, Kenya

The Grant's Gazelle (Nanger granti) is a species of gazelle. Their populations are distributed from northern Tanzania to southern Sudan and Ethiopia, and from the Kenyan coast to Lake Victoria.

The Grant's gazelle stands 30-36 inches up to the shoulder and weighs 100â€“145 pounds. Its coat is beigy orange on the back, with a white belly. The Grant's Gazelle looks similar to a Thomson's Gazelle except it has lyre-shaped horns which are stout at the base, clearly ringed and measuring 18 to 32 inches long. The subspecies are segregated by different morphological characters such as horn shape and slight differences in coat colour. These differences are not indicative of ecological separation as with some species.
