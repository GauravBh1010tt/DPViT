Thank you my friends on Flickr. This morning my Flickr stream recorded <b>350,161 views!</b> I am humbled by your kindness and love. It is the encouragement and creative criticism and learning from you all that sustains my photography. 
This is an image of a magnificent Black Buck (Antelope cervicapra) from Tal Chhappr Black Buck Sanctuary, District Churu, Rajasthan. It is heartening to see the fine state of upkeep of this wildlife sanctuary, whose antelope population is well over three thousand. Apart from antelopes like Black Buck and Nilgai, the Sanctuary also is home to mammals like deers, Indian Fox, and several species of reptiles including monitor lizards, spiny tail lizards, sand boas. The place also has incredible migratory and passage migrant population of raptors and other birds.
