Please feel free to take a look at more of my animal pictures in my <a href="#//www.flickr.com/photos/jinterwas/collections/72157623463773375/" rel="nofollow">&quot;all creatures great &amp; small&quot;-collection</a>. All photos are free to use, but I would appreciate credits :). All it takes is a link back to this page and/or a tag 'jinterwas' on your picture. 

IÂ´d also love to see the result of your creativity, so a link to your photo (or website you use this picture on) or a small size sample in the comment section would be great :)) !!

Please do not abuse the CC-licence by claiming anything in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jinterwas/">my photostream</a> as your own, nor to sell it on a compilation CD, the internet or any other way.

Thanks for looking at and/or using anything on my photostream. Any comment is much appreciated :) !!
