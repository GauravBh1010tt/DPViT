Addra Gazelle (Nanger dama ruficollis)


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
The Dama Gazelle (Nanger dama) is a species of gazelle that lives in Africa in the Sahara desert and migrates south in search of food during the dry season. The Addra subspecies, (Nanger dama ruficollis) is still present in the wild but quickly declining. Its numbers have fallen by 80% over the last decade, and the Dama Gazelle is now listed as Critically Endangered, though there are still as many as 2000 left. They occur in poor countries and little action is taken to protect the species, the national parks are not well guarded and poachings still occur. Captive populations are managed in zoos in Africa and America. Most Addra gazelles are now managed in zoos and AZA institutions in the United States according to a Species Survival Plan.
