Eland


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
The scientific name of the common eland is Taurotragus oryx, composed of three words: tauros, tragos and oryx. Tauros is Greek for a bull or bullock, meaning the same as the Latin taurus. Tragos is Greek for a male goat, referring to the tuft of hair that grows in the eland's ear and its resemblance to a goat's beard. Oryx is Latin and Greek (generally orygos) for pickaxe, referring to the pointed horns of North African antelopes like the common eland and scimitar-horned oryx.The name 'eland' is Dutch for &quot;elk&quot; or &quot;moose&quot;. It has a Baltic source similar to the Lithuanian Ã©lnis, which means &quot;deer&quot;. It was borrowed earlier as ellan (French) in the 1610s or Elend (German). When Dutch settlers came to the Cape Province they named it after the large, herbivorous moose. In Dutch the animal is called &quot;Eland antelope&quot; to distinguish it from the moose, which is found in the northern boreal forests.
