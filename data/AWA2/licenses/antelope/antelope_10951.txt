Thomson's gazelle


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
The holier than thou look on the male's face suggests that he is up to something! Thomson's gazelles live in Africa's savannas and grassland habitats, particularly the Serengeti region of Kenya and Tanzania. It has narrow habitat preferences, preferring short grassland with dry, sturdy foundation. It does, however, migrate into tall grassland and dense woodland. Gazelles are mixed feeders. In the wet seasons, gazelles eat mainly fresh grass, but during the dry seasons, they eat more varied fare, particularly foliage from bushes, forbs, and clovers.(Al Ain, UAE, Dec. 2012)
