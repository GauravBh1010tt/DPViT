Thomson's gazelle


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
A much older photograph shows this elegant male Thomson's gazelle sniffing about in the parched, dry sand. Pity they have to spend their lives in an area with such sparse grass. For more photos of Thomson's gazelles in the wild, see my Kenya Animals set. (Al Ain, UAE, July 2010)
