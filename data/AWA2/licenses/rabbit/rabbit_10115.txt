Being Alert Is Staying Alive - Sometimes


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
Behind Target on what looks like a hayfield of Bermuda Grass, Paradise Lane, Peoria Arizona.  Actually looks more like fogging; what the rabbits - usually two or three - find to eat, I don't know, given that they eschew the trefoils growing in amongst the grass.  There is a Palo Verde tree nearby on the same side of the road whose beany-like seeds might well be an additional source of food.
