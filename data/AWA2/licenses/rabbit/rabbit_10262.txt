Bunny!

|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
I was walking through a residential neighbourhood in Winnipeg with my nephew when we spotted a rabbit on someone's lawn. So we duly stopped to take a picture of it, and continued on our way. For about 100 feet, until we saw another rabbit in another yard. And about 6 more after that. Turns out Winnipeg has rabbits like Toronto has pigeons. Cuter though.
