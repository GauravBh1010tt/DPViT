bunny on our front porch step


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
This little bunny hopped up on our front porch and watched our neighbor mow his lawn for about an hour. As a result, our dogs and we watched the bunny for just as long. I think her nest is under a tree in the neighbor's yard and the mowing was a concern to this fuzzy little one.
