Bunny with weird fur thing I


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
I think this rabbit had a bit of a near miss and thus has a chunk of fur freestanding between his ears. But he styles it quite well as you'll see.

Updated: friend noted that it's probably the Shope papilloma virus. Ultimately, not good for the bunny.
