Look at this kit!

|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
Kit No. 5, peering out from the breeding hutch.  All five of them are just incredibly personable and curious.  If you haven't checked out <a href="http://www.wabbitcam.com" rel="nofollow">www.wabbitcam.com</a> yet, do it.  You can see the kits and their mother, Bess, 24 hours a day.
