Bunny

|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
I was suffering a whole bunch of Smeared Bunnys until I thought my hardware was broken, until I realized what was happening was massively out-ot-focus grass blades in the foreground were being spread out a mile wide.  Here the only blades are near the bunny.  Got 'em.
