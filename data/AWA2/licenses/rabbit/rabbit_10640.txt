|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
Aiyn, what's up doc? A rabbit with a carrot. Sound familiar? Rabbits graze heavily and rapidly for roughly the first half hour of a grazing period (usually in the late afternoon), followed by about half an hour of more selective feeding. In this time, the rabbit will also excrete many hard fecal pellets, being waste pellets that will not be reingested. If the environment is relatively non-threatening, the rabbit will remain outdoors for many hours, grazing at intervals. While out of the burrow, the rabbit will occasionally reingest its soft, partially digested pellets; this is rarely observed, since the pellets are reingested as they are produced. (Emirates Park Zoo, Samha, Abu Dhabi, Jan. 2015)
