Whale


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
A whale in the Antarctic. I can't tell which species and I can't remember either. It's probably a Humpback.
Whales love the Antarctic Ocean as their is so much Krill about, which is generally their favourite meal!
Humpbacks are famous for their bubble hunting technique. A number of them will dive down and then spiral up and in slowly blowing out air bubbles. As these rise it creates a decreasing area of water surrounded by bubbles trapping fish inside. The whales can then easily charge through, gobbling up all the fish!
