Dead Humpback Whale - Megaptera novaeangliae


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
On June 28, 2014 a recently deceased Humpback Whale washed ashore about 1/6 of a mile north of Hazard Reef in Monta√±a de Oro State Park, Calif.  A measurement of 35 feet indicated the whale may not have reached full maturity.  Adult Length, 40-50 ft, weight 25-40 lbs.  for more info I have a brief video.   <a href="http://youtu.be/cvSGR77Mx28" rel="nofollow">youtu.be/cvSGR77Mx28</a>

The tail, above the flukes had been severely injured (nearly severed).  Entanglement in fishing paraphernalia could be a likely cause of the injury.   

Statistics were being gathered by researchers from the Channel Islands Cetacean Research Unit.
