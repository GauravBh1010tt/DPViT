Humpback Whale (Megaptera novaeangliae)


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
I am fortunate that I see quite a few whales of different species on my Naturalist Journeys tours.  But I have to admit that it is not very often that one (actually two on this day) just floats at the surface ten feet away from our boat...
