Breaching Humpback Whale (Megaptera novaeangliae)


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
On this summer's trip to Alaska, we were again fortunate enough to have calm seas and clear weather out of Seward on a Kenai Fjords tour.  At least eight different marine mammal species put in an appearance.  This humpback whale was kind enough to breach four times next to our boat, giving me plenty of time to setup the focus and composition.  The Common Murre in the foreground did not seem the least bit perturbed...
