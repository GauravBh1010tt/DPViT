Humpback Whale


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
Humpbacks are curious animals, and so will approach boats, and as such are a popular sight for tourist trips. This chap was one of a few who regularly come close to the shore in Hermanus, providing some excellent on-shore whale watching!
