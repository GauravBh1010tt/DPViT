Whale Breach


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
A humpback whale breaches off the coast of Oahu in Hawaii. Each year, the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary hosts the 'Sanctuary Ocean Count.' Not only is this a fun volunteer activity for residents and visitors, but it also helps to provide important population and distribution information on humpback whales around the Hawaiian Islands.
