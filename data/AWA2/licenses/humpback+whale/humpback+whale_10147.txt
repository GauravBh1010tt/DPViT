Humpback bubbleburst


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
The whales' air bubbles rise to the surface and cast a &quot;net&quot; which traps food.  Out of nowhere the whole lot of them erupt in sync and come up the surface like a fireworks going off.  Startled and amazed everyone.  For a great description of this see
