Allie swimming backwards!

|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
The quality of this picture is pretty low, but for some reason the dolphin turned out pretty clear so I included it.  The show we went to lacked &quot;wow&quot; factor because all 3 dolphins were either the wrong age or not in condition to perform much.  It is still always fun watching these incredible and powerful animals swim and figure out their tricks.  

Here's some info on April, who was a bottlenosed dolphin that was previously housed at the MN Zoo, but passed away in February:

The zoo reports that the 44-year-old dolphin died after suffering physical ailments for the past few months. A necropsy, or animal autopsy, will determine the cause of death.

 

April was the mother of 22-year-old Allie, another dolphin at the Apple Valley zoo, and grandmother of Taijah (TAYâ€™-shah), born last summer. She had been at the zoo since January 2008 on loan from a Chicago zoo.
 
The Minnesota Zoo has another dolphin named Semo, who is 45 years old.
