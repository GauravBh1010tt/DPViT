|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
January 2013:  Pete Bethune, Scotty Bowman and friends carried out covert surveillance on illegal fishing boats threatening the habitat of the last remaining Maui's dolphins in New Zealand.

Despite producing good evidence of encroachment within marine protected areas, the authorities yet again did nothing.
