|  TITLE  |
+---------+
Swimming Mates (Bottlenose Dolphin - Tursiops Truncatus)


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
Adult males live mostly alone or in groups of two to three, and join pods for short periods of time. Adult female and young dolphins normally live in groups of up to 15 animals. However, they live in fission-fusion societies of varying group size, within which individuals change associations, often on a daily or hourly basis.

They can make a unique signature whistle that may help individual dolphins recognize each other or perform any other kind of communication still unknown. Dolphins even make noises so loud that can stunt fish.

Like other dolphin species, they live in groups called pods. This species is very social and they may create very large numbers. However, they also have subgroups within a larger pod that helps with the hierarchy of things. Typically, a pod can be from 10 to 100 members but those with significantly more in them have been identified. They have also been observed in the wild interacting with the Pilot Whale.
