Dolphin

|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
One of a pod of around 24 that came to visit south of Ireland.  

We were really shifting and quite proud of our 12/13 knots - and they wasted us!!! Awesome, beautiful creatures.

I was amazed to get so many shots of them in the air...and especially liked this one. She's being a bit lazy by driving out of the face of a large wave rather than jumping up and out.

They came at just the right time - after a few disasters breaking stuff onboard, these guys gave a real lift to our spirits

With many thanks to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/garnite/">Jim (Garnite)</a> - I now have a video clip (not great I admit) and you can <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/user=GoodDay" rel="nofollow">see it here</a>...along with a sneak preview of the gale shots that are to follow.
