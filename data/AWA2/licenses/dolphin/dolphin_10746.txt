Pod life -  Port side


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
Fabulous day on Monterey Bay in the midst of a huge pod of dolphins. Definitely a bucket list item. Pictures don't do it justice. This is the view to port! 

I shared a bit more information <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mark-gunn/27637573605">here</a>, if you're interested.
