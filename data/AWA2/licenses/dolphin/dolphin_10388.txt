Dolphin


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
A dolphin which can be seen in a luxury hotel at Moorea Island in French Polynesia. You can freely cross the hotel and observe it. Tourists can pay and swim with dolphins but personally I prefer to observe them in nature. I think that meeting a dolphin should be a matter of real will and not a matter of money.

For more photos of French Polynesia I invite you to visit my blog : <a href="http://abadie.photography.over-blog.com/2013/11/french-polynesia.html" rel="nofollow">abadie.photography.over-blog.com/2013/11/french-polynesia...</a>
