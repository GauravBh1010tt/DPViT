Panda Drape 2196


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
On <em>The Simpsons</em> there's a musical sequence occasioned by Mr. Burns having kidnapped all the Simpsons greyhound puppies (&quot;Two Dozen and One Greyhounds&quot;, season 6, episode 2F18), wherein he expounds on the lovely exotic animal-derived clothing he owns (&quot;See my vest / See my vest / Made of real gorilla chest&quot;).

I just wanted to share.
