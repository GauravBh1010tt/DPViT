|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
The panda's plight often makes me sad since these adorable creatures make life hard for themselves in their evolution, things like not hibernating and eating mainly large quantities of bamboo shots which have poor nutritional value.

However I was extremely happy to see a living one, since it was a childhood dream come true for me.
