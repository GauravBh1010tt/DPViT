Panda Breakfast, National Zoo


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
March was a bit of a crazy month for me, filled with long hours at work. My time for photography declined dramatically, and my time for Flickr vanished altogether. But things are a bit calmer now, and I've missed seeing what all my Flickr friends are up to, so I'm making a renewed effort to post and comment.

First up in the backlog of photos to share are some shots from the National Zoo. One of the conferences I attend regularly is in Washington DC every few years, at a hotel located very close to the zoo. This year my family came along, and we spent a lot of time watching the animals at the zoo. On our last morning in DC we were lucky enough to see the pandas outside snacking on some bamboo (+1 in comments).
