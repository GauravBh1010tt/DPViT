Dalmatian

SOME FACTS:

The Dalmatian is a breed of dog, noted for its white coat with either black or liver spots. Although other color variations do exist, any color markings other than black or liver are a disqualification in purebred Dalmatians. 

The famous spotted coat is unique to the Dalmatian breed; no other purebred dog breed features the distinctive spotted markings. 

The Dalmatian is a breed whose heritage is hotly disputed by researchers, who have not come to an agreement on where this spotted dog originated. Contrary to popular belief, there is no evidence that the breed originated in the Croatian province of Dalmatia.

Dalmatians are commonly known as firehouse dogs. 

The Dalmatian is also associated, particularly in the United States, with Budweiser beer and the Busch Gardens theme parks, since the Anheuser-Busch company's iconic beer wagon, drawn by a team of magnificent Clydesdale horses, is always accompanied by a Dalmatian.

The Dalmatian breed experienced a massive surge in popularity as a result of the 1956 novel The Hundred and One Dalmatians written by British author Dodie Smith, and later due to the two Walt Disney films based on the book.
