|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
We had our garbage bag hanging near our cooking table while we were cooking and eating.  Apparently the nightlife in New York don't wait for folks to go to bed before they come scavanging.  This fella showed up at 10:30pm or so and tried to tear open the garbage bag for a couple minutes before I took it away.
