We've Got Skunks


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
This pair goes everywhere together, and they are so cute!

And they seem oblivious to the cats or my camera moving in to about a foot above them.  The cats somehow know to keep their distance and they just huddle together and watch in rapt attention. (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tn9NSZ_eoYU&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="nofollow">short video</a>)

I went closer but kept a ready stance for a quick exit... 
and the little one did lift her tail once to give me a threatening wink of ole stink eye...
