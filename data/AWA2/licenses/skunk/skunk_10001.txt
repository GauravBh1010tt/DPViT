Pep√© Le Pew.  Chris and the kids were playing outside when they looked across the street and saw this!  They immediately yelled at the neighbors to close their garage.  Grandma told us a funny story about a skunk invading their garage once, so I guess I can understand.  My first thought was, &quot;I didn't know we had badgers in Texa.....SKUNK!!!!!!!&quot;
