|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
We have been getting some intersesting wild skunks at Nature Station at our bird feeders. &quot;Unibrow&quot; as he's been called, got his belly full at the feeder and then took a nap behind the trellis in one of the gardens. Visitors can possibly see the skunks around 4pm at Nature Station. Photo by Tim Johnson
