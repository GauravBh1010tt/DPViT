Young Skunks!


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
I heard noises, and the cats were paying a lot of attention to the front windows. So I peek outside and am met by one black-faced pointed nose peeking around the gate pillar. So I turned on the camera, set up flash, and went through the gate to find about six juvenile skunks who all swarmed around my ankles!

Here's three.
