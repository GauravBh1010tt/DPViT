|  TITLE  |
+---------+
Day 24 - West Midlands Police puppy 'Scooby' visits Coventry


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
Meet Scooby... an eleven week old police puppy!

Operational police dogs must have a sound temperament, be bold and courageous - not too aggressive. 

They spend a long time training and bonding with their handler. 

Chasing and detaining a fleeing person can become a highly-charged situation, so our dogs must be under the handler's control at all times. 

Their suitability is also constantly reviewed throughout their working life (usually around eight years). 

Learn more about West Midlands Police's Dog Unit on this link: <a href="http://www.west-midlands.police.uk/specialist-crime/dogs/index.asp" rel="nofollow">www.west-midlands.police.uk/specialist-crime/dogs/index.asp</a>

This image forms part of the West Midlands Police 'Photo of the Day 2012' project. 

We will be adding a new photo every day of the year to highlight the breadth of work carried out by police officers and staff across the West Midlands.
