+---------------+
My dog's more of a mouser than my cat! Go figure.

Checking out the would-be &quot;mouse house&quot;!

Phoebe alerted Gary to the fact that there was a mouse stowaway who'd managed to get into the Milk Bone box in the mud room! She was sniffing around it incessantlyâ€”giving it more attention than she would have if there were just doggie biscuits in it. The box had been opened but the flaps were closed, mind you.

Gary looked inside and found himself being looked back at! Hah! (Better him than me, I'm telling you!)
