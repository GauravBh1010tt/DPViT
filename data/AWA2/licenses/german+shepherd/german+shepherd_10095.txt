Bela, Echo, and Pucker


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
This Menage et trois lives with us.  Bela, a Beagle/Pit Bull mix  hates me!
Echo is a German Shepherd totally dedicated to my wife Elizabeth.  And Pucker is a Chihuahua we adopted as a stray in Phoenix 6 years ago.

As a birder, I often take long walks to the bird park a few miles a way.  Along the way, I often encounter dogs, some walking with their masters, some fenced in yards, and some roving strays.  Since my camera is always in my hand, I have taken to photographing the canine acquaintances.  Some have names, some are just Canines of California City.
I hope you enjoy them,
Phil Cowan, Birdtographer
