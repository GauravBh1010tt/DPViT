|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
Eight eager and well-trained canines – joined by their human partners – entered the ranks of the MTA Police Department’s Canine Unit at a graduation ceremony held on Friday, June 14, 2013, in Grand Central Terminal. The canines, who are roughly 1½ years old and are German Shepherds or German Shepherd/Belgian Shepherd mixes, completed an intensive 14-week course with their human partners in which they learned all aspects of explosives detection, recognition and handling. The MTA K-9 Unit is believed to be the largest such force in the nation, with 50 canines in service.
