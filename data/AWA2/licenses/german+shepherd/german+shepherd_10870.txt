Street Dog - Perfect Specimen


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
This is my favorite type of street dog. It has the large head and body of a German Shepherd, with the short legs of a Wiener Dog or a Beagle. I would refer to this variety as a &quot;Smooshed German Shepherd.&quot;
