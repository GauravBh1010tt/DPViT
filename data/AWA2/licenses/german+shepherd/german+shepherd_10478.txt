|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
Our German Shepherd dog Cody loves to open packages.  Ever since he was a puppy family members would include treats and dog bones in shipped boxes.  Now he assumes all packages are his including the Christmas presents under the Christmas tree.  So one day he decided to open his Christmas presents, only problem was he canâ€™t read the tags.  I guess he just assumed they were all his. 
DAMAGED CASE/DEVICE: ipad case
