Phoebe, when she first found us


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
Phoebe, October 04, 2001, the day she first found us. Six weeks old. 

She showed up with a mangy tail and hindquarters and a pathetic old flea collar around her neck. Subsequently, we also learned that she had worms after we took her to the vet for a check-over. 

Other than it appeared that she wasn't well-cared-for, we don't know if she was abused in any way. But we made no attempt to find her previous owners because of the condition she was in. We've stopped feeling that it wasn't right to keep her based on how much she seemed to love our attention and being with us, and we with her. But I am wondering if it was selfish or ethically wrong?
