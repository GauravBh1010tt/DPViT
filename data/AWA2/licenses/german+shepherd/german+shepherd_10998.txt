@ Hilo, Hawaiâ€˜i

David's thoughts about this picture selected in top 25 of 2012:
I was walking on the sidewalk around the city of Hilo to explore the fresh culture in state of Hawai'i.  Until the truck approaching the stop red light, I caught the eye of happy dog doing their modeling on back of the truck.  I chucked to see German shepherd, and the driver saw me while I shoot him.  It was a luck of the time to capture the picture before truck gone away in ten seconds.
