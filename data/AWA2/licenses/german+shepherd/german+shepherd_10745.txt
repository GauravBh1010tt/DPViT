Poor hot George ...


+---------------+
|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
It was so hot today and during the day when the workman are at the building site George is locked in his cage.  His coat is so thick and he desperately needs clipping and brushing to get rid of the old manky coat. 

All I could do was gently pluck bits of it out tonight through the holes in the fence. Beautiful boy he is calmly stood still and let me do it.
