|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
Ok, so I couldn't stop thinking about this poor dog all night, I even dreamt about him.  I kept wondering if there was any way I could &quot;rescue&quot; him.  So after a very restless night I naturally had to go back and see him again.

Again he wagged his tail when he saw me and the dogs and not once barked at us.  Sam and Millie were keen to get out of the car and have a play so they all had quite a lovely time despite the fence in between them.
